# RAS Group 8 Map

Map used for new packages. The structure is in large part inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/ethz-asl/ros_best_practices).

## Using the map

Follow these simple steps to use the map for setting up a new repo.

1. Create a bare repo (no README) on GitHub.
2. Clone the repo to your computer using `git clone https://github.com/RAS17-Group-8/ras_group8_map`.
3. `cd` into the cloned directory.
4. Do a `git push git@github.com:RAS17-Group-8/<repo-name>.git`, making sure you have setup SSH access in your GitHub account settings.
